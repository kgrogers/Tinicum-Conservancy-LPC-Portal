Please read the addition, changes and upgrade notes for JavaScript, which are important for PHP too
Addition and Changes
===================

- You will need to upgrade to the latest tcpdf or use the one distributed with the package.
- You will need to set the path_to_pdf when using  the new version

- Common: the default language file is English. In order to load you desired language 
  it is needed to set the new variable regional in grid options. Note that with this release it 
  is possible to have different language files for different grids on the same page. Suppose you want to use 
  Japan language file - you will need first to load the grid.locale-jp.js and then 

  $grid->setGridOptions(array(
  ...
  "regional"=>"jp",
  ...
  ));
- Common: Added autoloader class which automatically load the needed classes when is requiered.
- Common: Change of directory structure, separate clases in separate files.
- jqValidator: added a class which performs validation and sanitataion at server
- jqForm: added ui.jqform.css style  which should be included in the html page 
- jqForm: added new function addHtmlElement($name,  $content='') to add any html element in the form.
- jqForm: Added public properties $serverValidate (to enable/disable server validation) and $serverSanitize 
  to enable/disable server sanitatation). The default values of these is false.
- jqForm: Added method setValidationRules( $arule ) to set validation on the server. Works only if the  $serverValidate
  is set to true. The structure of the array is as follow
$validations = array(
    'name' => array("number"=>true, "required"=>true, "minValue"=>0, "maxValue"=>3, "sanitize"=>true),
    'email' => array('email'=>true, "required"=>true),
    'alias' => array('anything'=>true),
    'pwd'=>array('anything'=>true),
)

We suppor following types when validate: 'date' ,'datetime','time', 'alfanum', 'not_empty','words', 'anything', 
'string','text', 'number', 'float', 'int', 'integer', 'email', 'boolean', 'ip', 'url'

- jqForm : added new function setSanitatationRules( $arule ) to sanitize the user input. Work only if $serverSanitize
  is set to true. The structure of the array is as follow
  $sanitize = array('name','email','alias'); Note that the validations array should be set setValidationRules( $arule ) in order this to work.
  For a easy setup you can set in validation array "sanitize"=>true in order to perform the operation. 
  You can control booth operations using $serverSanitize and $serverValidate
  We support following types when sanitize: "url","int","integer","float","number","email","text","string".
  If the type can not be fount we use the default one - string.

- jqForm: added new function setView( $view = 'horizontal') to set a diffrent view on the form. The possible values of the
  $view pareameter are: horizontal, vertical, inline, table
- jqForm added new function setStyling( $style = 'jqueryui') to set a diffrent styling of the form. The default styling is
  jqueryui. When this is used the jquery ui css file should be included. The other option is 'bootstrap'. If this option
  is used the bootstrap css file should be included - see the updated demos.
- jqGrid: all the functions related to export are moved in separate class and file jqGridExport
- jqGrid: all the functions related to CRUD are moved to separate file and class jqGridEdit
- jqGrid: all the functions related to jqGrid rendering are moved to separate class and file jqGridrender
- jqGridExport: Added export to excel with creation of true Excel file. This is achieved with using the 
  PHP Excel class.
- jqGridExport: added function setExcelOptions( $exceloptions) to set various Excel options.
  The default values sre (see the updated demo)

		"file_type"=>"xml", //Excel2007,Excel5,xml
		"file"=>"", //excel file to be exported
		"start_cell" => "A1",
		"creator"=>"jqGrid",
		"author"=>"jqGrid",
		"title"=>"jqGrid Excel",
		"subject"=>"Office 2007 XLSX Document",
		"description"=>"Document created with Guriddo",
		"keywords"=>"Guriddo, jqGrid, Excel",
		"font"=>"Arial",
		"font_size"=>11,
		"header_title"=>"",
		"protect" => false,
		"password"=>"Guriddo",
		"path_to_phpexcel_class"=>"External/phpexcel/PHPExcel.php"
  To use the true export to excel you will need to have the PHP Excel lib installed and point the path to 
  it using path_to_phpexcel_class of the options. The SuitoPHP package comes standard with this lib.
- jqGridExport: added public variable $excelFunc. This is Custom function which can be called to modify the grid output
  before the output to excel. Parameters  passed to this function are the response object and the db connection
- jqGridExport: added public variable $excelClass.  Custom call can be used again with custom function customFunc. We can call
  this using static defined functions in class customClass::customFunc - i.e
  $grid->excelClass = Custom, $grid->excelFunc = myfunc
  $grid->excelClass = new Custom(), $grid->excelFunc = myfunc
- jqGridExport: added function getExcelOptions to get the current excel options
- jqUtil file is renamed to jqGridUtils for correct loading with autoloader
- jqScheduler: aded public variable $databasepath which point to database.php
- jqScheduler: it is possible now to define arbitrary fields in the database which is manipulated in scheduler.
  To do so the keys in dbmap protected array can be modified. The array is present in 
- jqScheduler: added support for PostgreeSQL and SQL Server databases.
- jqGrid: added Server validation and sanitatation. The setting of server validation is the same as in the form
  class. See above the code for jqForm server related validation
- Database drivers are moved to separate directory.
- jqVisual Form: added new variable in $DRIVER_PATH in jqformconfig.php which should poin to the database driver
- jqVisual Form: the FileTree class output only xml files
