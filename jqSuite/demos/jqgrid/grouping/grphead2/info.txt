Header grouping is a way to add a additional column above the header grid rows, 
so that they are grouped of desired way.

Grouping of the header should be used after the grid is created. 
For this purpose we have created a method which is called setGroupHeaders. 

We support two type of grouping - with colSpan enabled and colSpan disabled.
If the colSpan is disabled (the default) the headers that do not have grouping have a additional cell above it.
If the colSpan is enabled there is no additional cell above the non-grouped column and it is considered as one column. 

Below is a example with colSpan option set to false
