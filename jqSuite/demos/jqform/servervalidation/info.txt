It is possible to validate the user input on server side too.
For this purpose we use the build in PHP filter_var function.
We support a validation for: number, email, integer, boolean, ip, url, text, date and more.
Also we support, min, max and required properties

It is needed to use the setValidation methiod to achieve this goal.
See the PHP code tab.
