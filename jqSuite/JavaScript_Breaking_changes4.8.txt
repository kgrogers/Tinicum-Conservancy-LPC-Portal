This is a IMPORTANT upgrade guide to version 4.8.

1. The ui.jqgrid.css file should be replaced with the last one.
2. Language files (grid.locale-xx.js) should be replaced with the last one. If this is not performed a error will appear and grid will not be build.
3. The method GridUnload – i.e $(“#grid”).jqGrid(‘GridUnload’) does not have effect.
   Replace the old with the new one $.jgrid.gridUnload(‘#jqGridId’); where jqGridId is the id of the grid
4. The method GridDestroy – i.e $(“#grid”).jqGrid(‘GridDestroy’) does not have effect.
   Replace the old with the new one $.jgrid.gridDestroy(‘#jqGridId’); where jqGridId is the id of the grid
5. The method jqGridImport – i.e $(“#grid”).jqGrid(‘jqGridImport’,options) does not have effect.
   Replace the old with the new one $.jgrid.jqGridImport(‘#jqGridId’, options); where jqGridId is the id of the grid
6. The $.jgrid.defaults property is unchanged and it is possible to use $.extend($.jgrid.defaults, {…});
    All other parameter from the language file should be changed this way:
    Suppose the current language file is English, then extending the edit parameters should be replaced from

    $.extend($.jgrid.edit, {…});

    to

    $.extend($.jgrid.regional[‘en’].edit, {…});

    The same apply for all other parameters in language file.
7. To load your own language file you will need to setup the regional parameter in the grid.
    Let suppose that default language file should be grid.locale-cn.js, then in grid it is needed to do this:

    $("#jqGrid").jqGrid({
    ...
    regional : 'cn',
    ...
    });
    the code regional parameter in grid options correspond to the last two character in the javascript files
